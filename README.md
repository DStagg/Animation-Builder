# Animation-Builder
Basic tool for building sprite-based animations.

A (very) basic tool for defining sprite-based animation sequences.
Users can select, edit and save series of sub-rects of a source texture to create animated sequences.
The exported .anim file does not contain any texture data, only a series of rectangles defined by top-left coordinate and dimensions.

This probably isn't any use to anyone who isn't me but feel free to take a look regardless.
